# Pathfinding Visualizer
It is a fully functinaly and dynamic project where user can see realtime working of the pathfinding alogrithms like A*, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's.
## Functionalities
- Maze creation using Binary tree and Recursive Division algorithms.
- Select algorithm out of DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, A*.
- Select speed of running the algorithm as slow, normal, fast.
- Run the algorithm and get a visualization of how these algos work in a grid to find path from left-most grid point to right-most grid point.
## Tech Used
- ReactJs
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
